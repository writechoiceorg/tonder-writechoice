# Full SDK Overview

[Placeholder for Full SDK overview]

## What is the Full SDK?

The Full SDK provides pre-built, customizable UI components for payment processing. This is the fastest way to add payments to your website with professionally designed, battle-tested payment forms that work out of the box.

Instead of building payment forms from scratch, you get ready-to-use components that handle validation, error messages, security, and user experience automatically. You can customize the look and feel to match your brand while maintaining the reliability of our tested components.

**Key Features**: Pre-built payment forms • Customizable styling • Built-in validation • Secure card handling • 3DS support • Multiple payment methods

### When to Use Full SDK

**Perfect for:**
- Quick launches and MVPs
- E-commerce stores
- SaaS subscription pages
- Teams that want to focus on business logic, not payment UI

**Not recommended if:**
- You need 100% custom UI that doesn't match standard form patterns
- You want complete control over every pixel and interaction
- You have a dedicated design team requiring unique payment flows
