# Light SDK Overview

[Placeholder for Light SDK overview]

## What is the Light SDK?

The Light SDK is a "box of Lego pieces" - no built-in UI, just powerful tools to build your own checkout experience from scratch. This SDK gives you complete freedom to design and implement your payment flow exactly how you want it, without any visual constraints.

Think of it as the building blocks for payments: we handle the complex parts (tokenization, API communication, security), and you handle everything the user sees and interacts with. This is the choice for developers who want maximum control.

**Key Features**: No pre-built UI • Complete design control • Flexible integration • Secure tokenization • Multiple payment methods • 3DS support

### When to Use Light SDK

**Perfect for:**
- Custom-designed checkout experiences
- Mobile apps with native UI frameworks
- Unique user flows that don't match standard forms
- Teams with dedicated design and frontend resources
- Embedded payment flows in larger applications

**Not recommended if:**
- You need to launch quickly (use Full SDK instead)
- You don't have frontend development expertise
- Standard payment forms meet your needs
- You want to minimize development time

<Note>
  **Choosing between Light and Full SDK?**
  
  Light SDK requires more development time but gives you complete control. Full SDK is faster but with less UI flexibility.
  
  Most teams start with Full SDK and move to Light SDK only if they have specific design requirements that can't be met with customization.
