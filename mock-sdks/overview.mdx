# SDKs Overview

[Placeholder for SDK overview]

## What are Tonder SDKs?

Tonder SDKs provide pre-built components and simplified API handling to speed up your integration. Instead of building everything from scratch with direct API calls, our SDKs give you battle-tested tools that handle security, validation, and payment processing automatically.

Whether you need a fully pre-built checkout form or complete control over your UI, we have an SDK that matches your needs and technical requirements.

## Choose Your SDK

Select the SDK that best fits your platform and development approach. Each SDK type offers different levels of customization and development speed.

### Web SDKs

For web applications, Tonder offers two versions with different approaches to UI and integration complexity:

**Comparison:**

| Feature | Full SDK | Light SDK |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **UI Components** | Pre-built forms and elements | None - build your own |
| **Development Time** | Fast (days) | Medium (1-2 weeks) |
| **Customization Level** | High (styling & config) | Complete (full control) |
| **Best For** | Quick launches, standard flows | Custom designs, unique UX |
| **Complexity** | Low to Medium | Medium to High |
| **Use Case** | E-commerce, SaaS checkouts | Branded experiences, mobile apps |

  <Card title="Full SDK" icon="window" href="/mock-sdks/web/full-sdk/overview">
    **Pre-built UI components**  
    Perfect for quick integration with customizable, ready-to-use payment forms
  </Card>
  <Card title="Light SDK" icon="cubes" href="/mock-sdks/web/light-sdk/overview">
    **Build your own UI**  
    Complete control with no pre-built components - a "box of Lego pieces"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Accordion title="Need help choosing between Full and Light SDK?">
  **Choose Full SDK if:**
  - You want pre-built payment forms ready to use
  - You need quick implementation (launch in days)
  - You're okay with customizable styling (not fully custom UI)
  - You want to focus on business logic, not UI development
  
  **Choose Light SDK if:**
  - You need complete UI control and custom design
  - You want to build unique payment flows
  - You have specific design requirements or brand guidelines
  - You have the development resources for custom implementation
</Accordion>

### Mobile SDKs

For native mobile applications, Tonder provides SDKs for the most popular cross-platform frameworks. All mobile SDKs offer similar functionality with platform-specific optimizations:
