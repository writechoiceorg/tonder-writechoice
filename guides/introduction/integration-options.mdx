### Direct Integration (API)

Direct API integration offers complete control over both frontend and backend implementation, suitable for businesses that require custom payment flows and have the necessary security certifications.

- API integration requires the merchant company to be PCI-certified. The merchant also needs to forward their Attestation of Compliance (AOC) certification to Tonder before beginning the implementation.
- The merchant can completely customize the front and back end since the integration is a back-to-back implementation.
- Provides high flexibility in terms of design and functionality, allowing developers to create a tailored experience.
- Best suited for merchants that are PCI-certified and need a highly customized solution.

### E-commerce Plugins

Tonder's plugins provide the fastest path to accepting payments for businesses using popular e-commerce platforms, requiring no custom development.

- Tonder's plugins are designed to integrate easily into major e-commerce platforms with minimal configuration, without writing any code.
- Improves the checkout process and helps businesses accept more payment methods.
- Plugins are PCI-compliant, ensuring secure transactions.
- The most evident disadvantage is that plugin features depend on the platform, and some features may not be available.
- Ideal for businesses looking for quick and easy integration into their existing e-commerce platforms.

## Making the Decision

When deciding between the Tonder integration options, consider the following questions:


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much customization do you need?">
    For a highly tailored user experience, consider the Lite SDK or Direct Integration (API). For faster, standardized implementations, the Full SDK or e-commerce plugins are more suitable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is your timeline?">
    If you need to deploy quickly, the Full SDK or e-commerce plugins offer a faster path to implementation. Lite SDK and Direct Integration require more development time.
  </Accordion> 

  <Accordion title="What resources are available?">
    If you have the resources for custom development and integration, the Lite SDK or Direct Integration provides the flexibility you need. For teams with limited resources, the Full SDK or e-commerce plugins simplify the process.
  </Accordion> 

  <Accordion title="What are your security requirements?">
    If you are using Direct Integration (API), ensure you have the necessary PCI certification and AOC. The SDKs and e-commerce plugins include PCI compliance as part of the package.
  </Accordion> 
</AccordionGroup>

By carefully evaluating these factors, you can choose the Tonder integration that best meets your project's requirements, ensuring a successful implementation and a positive user experience.
