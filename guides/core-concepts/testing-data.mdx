## Understanding Test Scenarios

### 3D Secure Testing

The test cards above allow you to simulate different 3D Secure scenarios:

- **Challenge flow**: Requires customer interaction to complete authentication
- **Frictionless flow**: Authentication happens behind the scenes without customer interaction
- **No 3-D Secure**: Transactions processed without 3D Secure authentication

### Transaction Statuses

Test cards produce different transaction outcomes:

- **CONFIRMED**: Transaction successfully completed and confirmed
- **AUTHORIZED**: Payment has been authorised but not yet captured
- **DECLINED**: Payment was rejected by the card issuer

## Best Practices for Testing

When testing your Tonder integration:

1. **Test all scenarios**: Use cards that trigger both successful and declined transactions
2. **Verify 3DS flows**: Test both challenge and frictionless authentication flows
3. **Check status handling**: Ensure your application properly handles all transaction statuses
4. **Test error cases**: Use declined cards to verify your error handling logic
5. **Validate webhooks**: If using webhooks, confirm they trigger correctly for all scenarios
