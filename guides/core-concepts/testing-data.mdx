## Understanding Test Scenarios

Understanding what each test card simulates helps you verify your integration handles all payment scenarios correctly.

### 3D Secure Testing

The test cards above allow you to simulate different 3D Secure scenarios:

- A challenge flow that requires customer interaction to complete authentication.
- A frictionless flow that allows authentication to happen behind the scenes without customer interaction.
- Transactions processed without 3D Secure authentication.

### Transaction Statuses

Each test card is designed to return a specific transaction status, allowing you to test how your application handles different outcomes:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CONFIRMED | Transaction successfully completed and confirmed |
| AUTHORIZED | Payment has been authorised but not yet captured |
| DECLINED | Payment was rejected by the card issuer |

## Best Practices for Testing

Following these best practices ensures comprehensive testing coverage and helps identify issues before going live:

- Test all scenarios using cards that trigger both successful and declined transactions.
- Verify 3DS flows by testing both challenge and frictionless authentication flows.
- Check status handling to ensure your application properly handles all transaction statuses.
- Test error cases using declined cards to verify your error handling logic.
- Validate webhooks to confirm they trigger correctly for all scenarios (if using webhooks).
