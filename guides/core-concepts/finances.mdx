## Overview

The **Finances** module in Tonder provides a centralized platform for managing all financial aspects of your business. It is designed to offer complete visibility and transparency over your financial activities, from incoming sales to outgoing settlements.

Understanding the core concepts of balances and settlements is essential for effective cash flow management, risk mitigation, and strategic financial planning.

## Balances

A **balance** represents the amount of money in your Tonder account at any given time. Balances are categorized into different types to reflect the status of your funds.

* **In Transit**: These are funds from completed transactions that are on their way to your bank account but are not yet available for use.
* **Pending**: This balance consists of funds from transactions that have not yet been cleared or made available for disbursement.
* **In Reserve**: These are funds held by Tonder as a security measure to cover potential liabilities, such as chargebacks, refunds, or other risks associated with your transactions.

## Settlements

A **settlement** is the process of transferring funds from your Tonder account to your designated bank account. This process involves aggregating all your transactions over a specific period and disbursing the net amount.

The final settlement amount is calculated after accounting for the following:

* **Fees**: Costs associated with processing transactions, including charges for payment processing, refunds, and other services.
* **Refunds**: Funds returned to customers for reasons like merchandise returns or service cancellations. These amounts are deducted from your account balance.
* **Adjustments**: Any other corrections or changes made to your account balance, such as chargebacks or other financial activities.

By tracking your balances and settlements in the Tonder Dashboard, you can maintain healthy cash flow, manage risk effectively, and make informed decisions for budgeting and growth.
