Refunds allow you to return funds to customers for card transactions. You'll use this when you need to process customer returns, cancellations, or any situation requiring payment reversal. Understanding the refund process is crucial for managing customer relationships and maintaining accurate financial records.

<Note>
Refunds are only available for card payments. SPEI, OXXO, and Mercado Pago transactions cannot be refunded through the Tonder API.
</Note>

## When to Issue Refunds

Common scenarios for processing refunds include:

- Customer returns merchandise within your return policy window.
- Customer cancels before shipment or service delivery.
- Issues with service quality or delivery.
- Accidental double-charging of a customer.
- Customer service recovery or compensation.

## Refund Types

Tonder supports two types of refunds:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Full Refund">
A full refund returns the complete transaction amount to the customer. This is appropriate when:

- Customer returns all items from an order.
- Order is completely cancelled.
- Service is not provided at all.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Partial Refund">
A partial refund returns only a portion of the original transaction amount. Use this when:

- Customer returns only some items from an order.
- Applying a discount or credit for service issues.
- Refunding shipping costs but keeping product charges.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


<Warning>
**Important refund constraints**
- Refunds work exclusively with credit and debit card transactions.
- Each transaction can only be refunded once (partial or full).
- Refunds must be processed within 120 days after payment confirmation.
- The refund amount cannot exceed the original transaction amount.
</Warning>

## How Refunds Work

The refund process involves several stages:

<Steps>
<Step title="Refund Initiation">
To initiate a refund, you submit a request through the Tonder API with the following required information:

- The original transaction ID.
- The refund amount (full or partial).
- The currency (must match the original transaction).
</Step>

<Step title="Processing">
Tonder processes the refund request and communicates with the payment provider. The refund is typically approved immediately, but the actual transfer of funds depends on the customer's bank.
</Step>

<Step title="Settlement">
After processing, the funds are returned to the customer's original payment method. Settlement times vary by card type:

- 3-5 business days for credit cards.
- 5-10 business days for debit cards.
- Timing may vary depending on the card issuer and banking institution.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Refund Statuses

During the refund lifecycle, transactions will progress through various statuses that indicate their current state:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Success` | Refund has been successfully processed |
| `Pending` | Refund is being processed |
| `Failed` | Refund attempt failed |
| `Rejected` | Refund was rejected by the payment provider |

## Processing a Refund

Before submitting a refund request to the Tonder API, ensure you have the following required information:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Original transaction ID | The unique identifier from the original payment |
| Refund amount | The amount to refund (can be partial or full) |
| Currency | Must match the original transaction currency |

<Tip>
For implementation details and code examples, see the [Refund a Payment](/direct-integration/guides/refund-a-payment) guide in the Direct Integration section.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

Follow these recommendations when processing refunds:

- Maintain logs of all refund requests and their outcomes.
- Inform customers when refunds are processed and expected timeframes.
- Always ensure refund amounts don't exceed the original transaction.
- Store the refund transaction ID for reconciliation and customer service.
- Monitor refund patterns as high rates may indicate product or service issues.
- Establish and communicate clear refund policies to customers.

## Common Refund Errors

Understanding common errors helps you handle refunds more effectively:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Already Refunded">
This error occurs when attempting to refund a transaction that has already been refunded, either partially or fully. Each transaction in Tonder can only be refunded once.

To avoid this error, maintain a local record of all refunded transactions in your system. Always check whether a transaction has been previously refunded before initiating a new refund request.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Invalid Amount">
This error occurs when the refund amount exceeds the original transaction amount. The refund system validates that you cannot refund more than what was originally charged.

To prevent this error, always validate refund amounts against the original transaction total before submitting requests. Implement proper validation logic in your application to ensure the refund amount is less than or equal to the original payment amount.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transaction Not Found">
This error occurs when the system cannot locate the original transaction or the transaction is not eligible for refunds. This can happen with invalid transaction IDs, non-card payments (SPEI, OXXO, Mercado Pago), transactions older than 120 days, or incomplete transactions.

To resolve this issue, verify the transaction ID is correct and ensure the transaction is a completed card payment within the 120-day refund window. Double-check that you're attempting to refund a card transaction, as other payment methods cannot be refunded through the API.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Refund Window Expired">
This error occurs when attempting to refund a transaction that exceeds the 120-day time limit. Card networks enforce this restriction, and transactions older than this cannot be refunded.

To avoid this error, process refunds promptly when customers request them. Monitor your refund queue regularly and prioritize older transactions that are approaching the 120-day deadline.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Financial Impact

Refunds have several important impacts on your account's financial standing that you should be aware of:

- Processing fees from the original transaction are typically not refunded.
- Refunded amounts may be deducted from your available balance.
- Refunds appear as separate line items in your financial reports.
- Refunds reduce your net settlement amounts.
