'og:description': "Learn how disputes (chargebacks) work, how to manage them in the Tonder Dashboard, and best practices for submitting evidence to challenge them."
---

A dispute, also known as a chargeback, occurs when a customer contacts their card issuer (bank) to question or raise a concern about a payment. This action initiates a formal process on the card network, which results in an immediate reversal of the payment.

When a dispute is initiated, the transaction amount and an associated dispute fee are deducted first from Tonder and subsequently from your account balance.

## How Disputes Work

The dispute process follows a standardised flow across card networks.

<Steps>
<Step title="Cardholder Initiates Dispute">
The customer contacts their bank to dispute a charge.
</Step>

<Step title="Payment Reversal">
The card network immediately reverses the payment.
</Step>

<Step title="Funds Deducted">
The payment amount and a dispute fee are deducted from your Tonder account balance.
</Step>

<Step title="Evidence Submission">
You have the opportunity to accept the dispute or challenge it by submitting evidence.
</Step>

<Step title="Bank Resolution">
The issuing bank reviews the evidence and makes a final decision, which typically takes 2-3 months.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Disputes in Tonder

You can handle disputes securely and efficiently directly from the **Disputes** page in your Tonder Dashboard. For each dispute, you have two options:

- Acknowledge the cardholder's claim as valid by accepting the dispute. This closes the dispute, and the funds are permanently returned to the customer.
- Contest the dispute by providing compelling evidence to the card issuer to prove the transaction was legitimate.

<Note>
  The evidence submission process in the Dashboard is exclusively for transactions processed using **Tonder Online Payments**. For other Payment Service Providers (PSPs), you must manage disputes through their respective admin panels.
</Note>

### Timing and Deadlines

Understanding the timeline for disputes helps you respond appropriately and protect your business interests:

- Cardholders can typically initiate a dispute up to 120 days after the original transaction date.
- It's highly recommended to submit your evidence within 10 calendar days of receiving the dispute notification to ensure it's processed in time.
- After you submit evidence, the issuing bank usually takes 60 to 75 days to review it and make a final decision. The entire process can take 2-3 months from start to finish.

<Warning>
Businesses cannot accelerate the dispute resolution timeline, as it is dictated by card network rules and bank procedures.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Dispute Fees**: Dispute fees are defined in your contract with Tonder. These fees are deducted from your reserves whenever a cardholder initiates a dispute, regardless of the outcome.
</Note>

## Dispute Reason Codes

Payment networks assign a specific reason code to each dispute. Understanding these codes helps you identify the customer's claim and prepare the right evidence.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="10.4 Fraudulent Transaction — Card-Absent Environment">
        The customer claims they did not authorise the transaction.
        
        To challenge this dispute, provide proof of 3D Secure authentication or a signed proof of delivery for physical goods.
      </Accordion>

## Building Strong Evidence

When challenging a dispute, the quality and relevance of your evidence can make the difference between winning and losing the case. The type of evidence needed depends on the dispute reason code and the customer's claim.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="For Fraud Disputes">
When challenging fraud-related disputes, provide technical evidence that validates the customer's identity and authorization:

- Proof that the customer completed 3D Secure authentication.
- Confirmation that billing address matched through AVS (Address Verification System).
- Proof that security code was provided and verified (CVV verification).
- Show the transaction originated from customer's location using IP address and geolocation data.
- Technical data linking the device to the customer (device fingerprint).
- Evidence of successful past transactions from the same customer.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="For Product/Service Disputes">
For disputes claiming products weren't received or didn't match the description, documentation proving fulfillment is essential:

- Signed delivery receipts or tracking information proving the customer received the items.
- Screenshots showing accurate product representation on your site.
- Emails or messages exchanged with the customer.
- Proof customer agreed to your terms and conditions.
- Documentation of your refund and return policies.
- Proof that services were rendered as described.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="For Subscription Disputes">
When dealing with subscription-related chargebacks, demonstrate clear customer consent and proper notice:

- Proof of customer enrollment in the subscription.
- Customer consent for recurring charges (recurring billing agreement).
- Clear documentation of how to cancel the subscription.
- Proof customer used the service after the disputed charge.
- Proof of billing reminders sent to customer prior to each charge.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Disputes vs. Refunds

Understanding the key differences between disputes and refunds helps you choose the appropriate action for each situation:

| Aspect | Refund | Dispute |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Initiated by** | Merchant | Customer (via bank) |
| **Control** | You control timing and amount | Customer and bank control process |
| **Fees** | Original processing fees not returned | Dispute fee charged (non-refundable) |
| **Timing** | Immediate processing | 2-3 months resolution time |
| **Outcome** | Guaranteed return of funds | Uncertain; depends on evidence |
| **Impact on merchant** | Lower impact on reputation | Can affect merchant account standing |

<Tip>
When possible, resolve customer issues directly through refunds to avoid the dispute process and associated fees.
</Tip>

## Preventing Disputes

Taking proactive measures can significantly reduce your dispute rates and protect your business reputation. Here are key strategies:

- Provide accurate product descriptions, transparent policies, and clear refund terms that customers can easily find and understand.
- Respond quickly to customer inquiries and resolve issues with voluntary refunds before customers escalate to their bank.
- Ensure your business name appears clearly on customer statements to avoid confusion.
- Use tracked shipping with signature confirmation for physical goods.
- Implement 3DS2 authentication and leverage Tonder's fraud detection tools for enhanced security.

<Warning>
**Impact on Your Business**

High dispute rates can result in increased processing fees, reserve requirements, account reviews, or even account termination by payment processors. They can also indicate underlying service or product issues that damage your reputation. Maintain dispute rates below 0.9% of transaction volume to avoid penalties.
</Warning>
