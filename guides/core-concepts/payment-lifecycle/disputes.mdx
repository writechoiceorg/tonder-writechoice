## What is a Dispute?

A **dispute**, also known as a chargeback, occurs when a customer contacts their card issuer (bank) to question or raise a concern about a payment. This action initiates a formal process on the card network, which results in an immediate reversal of the payment.

When a dispute is initiated, the transaction amount and an associated dispute fee are deducted first from Tonder and subsequently from your account balance.

## How Disputes Work

The dispute process follows a standardised flow across card networks.


1.  **Cardholder Initiates Dispute**: The customer contacts their bank to dispute a charge.
2.  **Payment Reversal**: The card network immediately reverses the payment.
3.  **Funds Deducted**: The payment amount and a dispute fee are deducted from your Tonder account balance.
4.  **Evidence Submission**: You have the opportunity to accept the dispute or challenge it by submitting evidence.
5.  **Bank Resolution**: The issuing bank reviews the evidence and makes a final decision, which typically takes 2-3 months.

## Managing Disputes in Tonder

You can handle disputes securely and efficiently directly from the **Disputes** page in your Tonder Dashboard. For each dispute, you have two options:

* **Accept**: Acknowledge the cardholder's claim as valid. This closes the dispute, and the funds are permanently returned to the customer.
* **Challenge**: Contest the dispute by providing compelling evidence to the card issuer to prove the transaction was legitimate.

<Note>
  The evidence submission process in the Dashboard is exclusively for transactions processed using **Tonder Online Payments**. For other Payment Service Providers (PSPs), you must manage disputes through their respective admin panels.
</Note>

### Timing and Deadlines

* **Initiation Window**: Cardholders can typically initiate a dispute up to **120 days** after the original transaction date.
* **Evidence Submission**: It's highly recommended to submit your evidence within **10 calendar days** of receiving the dispute notification to ensure it's processed in time.
* **Resolution Window**: After you submit evidence, the issuing bank usually takes **60 to 75 days** to review it and make a final decision. The entire process can take 2-3 months from start to finish.

<Warning>
Businesses cannot accelerate the dispute resolution timeline, as it is dictated by card network rules and bank procedures.
</Warning>

### Dispute Fees

Dispute fees are defined in your contract with Tonder. These fees are deducted from your reserves whenever a cardholder initiates a dispute, regardless of the outcome.

## Dispute Reason Codes

Payment networks assign a specific reason code to each dispute. Understanding these codes helps you identify the customer's claim and prepare the right evidence.

## Building Strong Evidence

When challenging a dispute, the quality of your evidence is critical. Effective evidence typically includes:

### For Fraud Disputes

- **3D Secure authentication logs**: Proof that the customer completed authentication
- **AVS (Address Verification System) match**: Confirmation that billing address matched
- **CVV verification**: Proof that security code was provided and verified
- **IP address and geolocation**: Show the transaction originated from customer's location
- **Device fingerprint**: Technical data linking the device to the customer
- **Previous purchase history**: Evidence of successful past transactions

### For Product/Service Disputes

- **Proof of delivery**: Signed delivery receipts or tracking information
- **Product descriptions**: Screenshots showing accurate product representation
- **Communication logs**: Emails or messages with the customer
- **Terms and conditions**: Proof customer agreed to your policies
- **Cancellation policy**: Documentation of refund and return policies
- **Service records**: Proof that services were rendered as described

### For Subscription Disputes

- **Signup records**: Proof of customer enrollment
- **Recurring billing agreement**: Customer consent for recurring charges
- **Cancellation policy**: Clear documentation of how to cancel
- **Usage logs**: Proof customer used the service after the disputed charge
- **Notification records**: Proof of billing reminders sent to customer

## Disputes vs. Refunds

Understanding the difference helps you choose the appropriate action:

| Aspect | Refund | Dispute |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Initiated by** | Merchant | Customer (via bank) |
| **Control** | You control timing and amount | Customer and bank control process |
| **Fees** | Original processing fees not returned | Dispute fee charged (non-refundable) |
| **Timing** | Immediate processing | 2-3 months resolution time |
| **Outcome** | Guaranteed return of funds | Uncertain; depends on evidence |
| **Impact on merchant** | Lower impact on reputation | Can affect merchant account standing |

<Tip>
When possible, resolve customer issues directly through refunds to avoid the dispute process and associated fees.
</Tip>

## Preventing Disputes

Proactive measures to reduce dispute rates:

1. **Clear communication**: Provide accurate product descriptions and transparent policies
2. **Fast customer service**: Respond quickly to customer inquiries and complaints
3. **Recognisable billing descriptor**: Ensure your business name appears clearly on statements
4. **Delivery confirmation**: Use tracked shipping with signature confirmation
5. **3D Secure authentication**: Implement 3DS2 for enhanced fraud protection
6. **Fraud screening**: Use Tonder's fraud detection tools
7. **Clear refund policy**: Make return and refund policies easy to find and understand
8. **Proactive refunds**: Resolve issues with voluntary refunds before customers dispute

## Impact on Your Business

High dispute rates can have serious consequences:

- **Increased fees**: Higher dispute rates may result in increased processing fees
- **Account holds**: Excessive disputes can trigger reserve requirements or account reviews
- **Payment processor penalties**: Very high rates may result in account termination
- **Reputation damage**: Customer disputes can indicate service or product issues

**Industry benchmarks**: Maintain dispute rates below 0.9% of transaction volume to avoid penalties.
