## Overview

A payment represents the initial stage of the transaction lifecycle where a customer initiates a purchase and the payment is authorized. Understanding how payments work in Tonder is essential for integrating payment processing into your application and ensuring a smooth checkout experience for your customers.

## How Payments Work

When a customer makes a purchase, Tonder processes the payment through the following stages:

### 1. Payment Initiation

The customer provides their payment information through your checkout interface. This can include:

- **Card details**: Card number, CVV, expiry date, and cardholder name
- **Alternative payment methods**: SPEI, OXXO, digital wallets, and other local payment options
- **Saved payment methods**: Previously tokenized cards or payment instruments

### 2. Payment Authorization

Tonder sends the payment request to the appropriate payment processor or acquiring bank. The processor validates the payment details and checks:

- Available funds or credit limit
- Card validity and expiry status
- Fraud detection and risk assessment
- Customer authentication (including 3D Secure when required)

### 3. Response Handling

The payment processor returns an authorization response, which can be:

- **Authorized**: The payment has been approved and funds are reserved
- **Declined**: The payment was rejected (insufficient funds, invalid card, etc.)
- **Pending**: The payment requires additional action (3DS authentication, manual review)

## Payment Statuses

Throughout the payment process, transactions can have different statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Transaction is being processed (common for asynchronous payments) |
| `on_hold` | Transaction is temporarily held for review |
| `processing` | Transaction is being processed by the payment provider |
| `sent_to_provider` | Transaction has been sent to the payment provider |
| `authorized` | Payment has been authorized (common for card payments) |
| `success` | Transaction completed successfully |
| `paid_full` | Payment has been fully processed and settled |
| `declined` | Payment was declined by the provider |
| `rejected` | Transaction was rejected |
| `failed` | Transaction failed to process |
| `canceled` | Transaction was cancelled before completion |
| `expired` | Transaction expired before completion |

## Payment Methods

Tonder supports a wide range of payment methods to cater to different customer preferences:

### Card Payments

Accept payments from major card networks including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Carnet. Card payments are typically processed synchronously, providing immediate authorization results.

### Alternative Payment Methods

- **Bank Transfers (SPEI)**: Direct bank-to-bank transfers popular in Mexico
- **Cash Payments (OXXO)**: Voucher-based payments at convenience stores
- **Digital Wallets**: Mercado Pago and other local wallet solutions

<Tip>
For detailed information about each payment method and country-specific availability, see the [Available Payment Methods](/guides/payment-methods/available-payment-methods) page.

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Payments

Different payment methods have different processing flows:

### Synchronous Payments

Card payments are typically synchronous. You receive an immediate response with the final status (`authorized` or `declined`) in the initial API response. This allows for instant confirmation at checkout.

### Asynchronous Payments

Alternative payment methods like SPEI and OXXO are asynchronous. The initial status will be `pending` because they require the customer to take further action (complete the bank transfer or pay at a store). You must use webhooks or status polling to know when the payment is completed.

## Best Practices

When implementing payments with Tonder, follow these best practices:

1. **Always validate the response**: Check both the `id` and `status` fields in the API response
2. **Implement webhooks**: Use webhooks for asynchronous payment methods to receive real-time updates
3. **Handle errors gracefully**: Provide clear error messages to customers when payments fail
4. **Store transaction IDs**: Save the transaction ID for future reference and reconciliation
5. **Test thoroughly**: Use test cards and sandbox environment before going live
