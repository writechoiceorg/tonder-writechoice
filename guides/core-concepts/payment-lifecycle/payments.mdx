A payment represents the initial stage of the transaction lifecycle where a customer initiates a purchase and the payment is authorized. Understanding how payments work in Tonder is essential for integrating payment processing into your application and ensuring a smooth checkout experience for your customers.

## How Payments Work

When a customer makes a purchase, Tonder processes the payment through the following stages:

<Steps>
<Step title="Payment Initiation">
The customer provides their payment information through your checkout interface. This can include card details (card number, CVV, expiry date, and cardholder name), alternative payment methods (SPEI, OXXO, digital wallets), or previously tokenized cards and payment instruments.
</Step>

<Step title="Payment Authorization">
Tonder sends the payment request to the appropriate payment processor or acquiring bank. The processor validates the payment details and checks:

- Available funds or credit limit.
- Card validity and expiry status.
- Fraud detection and risk assessment.
- Customer authentication, including 3D Secure when required.
</Step>

<Step title="Response Handling">
The payment processor returns an authorization response with one of the following outcomes:

| Response | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Authorized | The payment has been approved and funds are reserved |
| Declined | The payment was rejected due to insufficient funds, invalid card, or other issues |
| Pending | The payment requires additional action such as 3DS authentication or manual review |
</Step>
</Steps>

## Payment Statuses

Throughout the payment process, transactions can have different statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Transaction is being processed (common for asynchronous payments) |
| `on_hold` | Transaction is temporarily held for review |
| `processing` | Transaction is being processed by the payment provider |
| `sent_to_provider` | Transaction has been sent to the payment provider |
| `authorized` | Payment has been authorized (common for card payments) |
| `success` | Transaction completed successfully |
| `paid_full` | Payment has been fully processed and settled |
| `declined` | Payment was declined by the provider |
| `rejected` | Transaction was rejected |
| `failed` | Transaction failed to process |
| `canceled` | Transaction was cancelled before completion |
| `expired` | Transaction expired before completion |

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Payments

Different payment methods have different processing flows:

- Synchronous payments (cards) provide an immediate response with the final status (`authorized` or `declined`) in the initial API response. This allows for instant confirmation at checkout.
- Asynchronous payments (SPEI, OXXO) return an initial status of `pending` because they require the customer to take further action (complete the bank transfer or pay at a store). You must use webhooks or status polling to know when the payment is completed.

## Best Practices

When implementing payments with Tonder, follow these best practices:

-  Always validate the response by checking both the `id` and `status` fields in the API response.
- Implement webhooks for asynchronous payment methods to receive real-time updates.
- Handle errors gracefully by providing clear error messages to customers when payments fail.
- Store transaction IDs for future reference and reconciliation.
- Test thoroughly using test cards and sandbox environment before going live.
