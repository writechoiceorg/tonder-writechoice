# Direct API Overview

[Placeholder for Direct API overview]

## What is Direct API Integration?

Direct API integration gives you complete control by letting you build your payment flow from scratch using Tonder's REST API. This approach offers maximum flexibility but requires more development effort and ongoing maintenance.

With Direct API, you make HTTP requests to our endpoints for every payment operation - tokenization, processing, refunds, and more. You build your own UI, handle your own validation, and manage the entire user experience. This is the choice for teams with specific technical requirements that can't be met by SDKs or Hosted Checkout.

## Key Features

Understanding what Direct API integration offers and requires:

- **Complete Control**: Build exactly what you need without any framework constraints
- **No Dependencies**: Pure REST API - no SDKs or libraries required (but available if desired)
- **Custom Workflows**: Implement complex business logic and multi-step flows
- **Full Flexibility**: Total freedom in UI, UX, and integration architecture
- **Maximum Customization**: Every aspect of the payment experience is in your hands

## Comparison with Other Integration Methods

Choose the integration method that matches your technical requirements and resources:

| Feature | Direct API | SDKs | Hosted Checkout |
|---------|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **Implementation Time** | Weeks to Months | Days to Weeks | Hours |
| **Development Complexity** | High | Medium | Low |
| **UI Control** | Complete | High | None |
| **Flexibility** | Maximum | High | Limited |
| **Code Required** | Extensive | Moderate | Minimal |
| **PCI Compliance** | Your responsibility | Simplified | Handled by Tonder |
| **Maintenance** | High | Low | None |
| **Best For** | Complex custom flows | Standard integrations | Quick launches |
| **Team Size Needed** | Medium to Large | Small to Medium | Any size |

## When to Use Direct API

Direct API is powerful but requires significant investment. Make sure it's the right choice:

**Perfect for:**
- Large development teams with API expertise
- Complex custom requirements that SDKs can't meet
- Unique business logic or multi-step payment flows
- Applications requiring complete UI/UX control
- Microservices architectures needing API-first integration
- Teams with dedicated backend and security resources

**Not recommended if:**
- Limited development resources or small teams
- Need quick implementation or tight deadlines
- Standard checkout flow meets your needs
- You don't have expertise in payment security and PCI compliance
- You want to minimize ongoing maintenance

<Warning>
  **Important:** Direct API integration makes you responsible for PCI compliance. Card data handling, security, and validation are entirely your responsibility. Consider SDKs or Hosted Checkout if you want Tonder to handle these concerns.
</Warning>

## Want Faster Implementation?

If Direct API seems too complex for your current needs, these alternatives offer faster integration:
