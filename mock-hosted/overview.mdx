# Hosted Checkout Overview

[Placeholder for Hosted Checkout overview]

## What is Hosted Checkout?

Hosted Checkout is a fully managed payment page hosted by Tonder. This is the absolute fastest way to start accepting payments - no payment forms to build, no UI to design, just a simple redirect to our secure, pre-built checkout page.

When a customer is ready to pay, you redirect them to Tonder's hosted page where they complete their payment, then we redirect them back to your site. The entire payment UI is managed by us, so you can focus entirely on your core business.

## Key Benefits

Understanding why Hosted Checkout might be the right choice for your business:

- **Fastest Implementation**: Go live in hours, not weeks - minimal code required
- **PCI Compliance**: Handled entirely by Tonder - card data never touches your servers
- **Secure & Tested**: Battle-tested checkout flow used by thousands of businesses
- **Minimal Code**: Simple redirect integration - no complex frontend development
- **Auto Updates**: Always on the latest version with new features and payment methods automatically
- **No Maintenance**: We handle updates, security patches, and optimization

## Comparison with Other Integration Methods

Choose the integration method that best fits your needs and resources:

| Feature | Hosted Checkout | SDKs | Direct API |
|---------|----------------|------|------------|
| **Implementation Time** | Hours | Days to Weeks | Weeks to Months |
| **Development Required** | Minimal (redirect only) | Medium | Extensive |
| **UI Control** | None (Tonder's UI) | High | Complete |
| **PCI Compliance** | Easiest (Tonder handles) | Simplified | Your responsibility |
| **Customization** | Limited (branding only) | High | Unlimited |
| **Maintenance** | None (managed by Tonder) | Low | High |
| **Best For** | Quick launches, small teams | Standard integrations | Complex custom flows |

## How It Works

1. Create a checkout session
2. Redirect customer to Tonder
3. Customer completes payment
4. Redirect back to your site
5. Receive webhook notification

## When to Use Hosted Checkout

Hosted Checkout is ideal for specific use cases but may not fit every business model:

**Perfect for:**
- Quick launches and MVPs needing immediate payment acceptance
- Small development teams or non-technical founders
- Standard checkout flows without special requirements
- Businesses prioritizing security and PCI compliance simplicity
- Projects with limited frontend development resources
- Marketplaces or platforms needing consistent checkout UX

**Not recommended if:**
- You need complete UI control to match custom designs
- You want embedded checkout within your application flow
- You have complex custom flows or multi-step processes
- You need to collect additional data during payment
- You want complete control over the user experience
